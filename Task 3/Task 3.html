        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Home Automation Using Arduino</h4>
                <p>
                    The main objective of this project is to develop a home
                    automation system using an Arduino board with Bluetooth
                    being remotely controlled by any Android OS smart phone.
                    As technology is advancing so houses are also getting
                    smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from
                    conventional switches to centralized control system,
                    involving remote controlled switches. Presently,
                    conventional wall switches located in different parts of the
                    house makes it difficult for the user to go near them to
                    operate. Even more it becomes more difficult for the
                    elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. Remote
                    controlled home automation system provides a most
                    modern solution with smart phones. In order to achieve
                    this, a Bluetooth module is interfaced to the Arduino board
                    at the receiver end while on the transmitter end, a GUI
                    application on the cell phone sends ON/OFF commands to
                    the receiver where loads are connected. By touching the
                    specified location on the GUI, the loads can be turned
                    ON/OFF remotely through this technology. The loads are
                    operated by Arduino board through opto- isolators and
                    thyristors using triacs.
                </p>
            <li>
                <h4>Web technology mini Project</h4>
                <p>
                    This program demonstrates the structure of HTML5 files and
                    semantic structure
                    followed. Writing of functions in Java script and form based event
                    handling in Java script is
                    also illustrated. The dynamic processing of Java script without
                    reloading HTML5 pages is
                    also shown.
